# Industrial Steel Defect Detection

This application takes the steel image and mark the defected patch on the image with defect type mentioned on it.
Each image may have no defects, a defect of a single class, or defects of multiple classes. For each image you must segment defects of each class (ClassId = [1, 2, 3, 4]). [Steel defect detection](https://github.com/luckyRajputana/Steel-Defect-Detection).
